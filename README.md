# ðŸ”‘ React Auth Template
## Design
This template was designed for personal use. Such that react routers and authentication handling on the Front-end no longer would be an issue. Which makes the application able to take a variety of API's and translate them into viewable Front-end modules.

## Status
The project is currently still a work in progress and is often revisited.
